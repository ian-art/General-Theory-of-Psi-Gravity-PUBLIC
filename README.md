## 🔭 Overview

This repository presents the **clean and public-facing version** of my research into ψ-gravity: a speculative framework where gravitational effects emerge from the Laplacian curvature of a combined space–current term, scaled by a generative field ψ(x, t).  

While the **private repository** preserves the raw, timestamped research log (with full commit history, typos, and drafts intact), this **public edition** is curated for clarity: phases are cleaned, language is polished, and explanations are structured for readability.  

The name, in homage to Einstein, reflects my intent to explore ψ-gravity as a wide-reaching framework: the **General Theory of ψ-Gravity**.

## 🌌 Core Equation

Gravity(x, t) = ∇²[space(x) + current(x)²] × ψ(x, t)
Force(x, t) = −∇[Gravity(x, t)]


Plaintext format:  
- Gravity(x, t) = Laplacian of [space + current²] × ψ(x, t)  
- Force(x, t)   = Negative gradient of Gravity(x, t)  

ψ(x, t) is the generative field that modulates curvature and thus defines gravitational strength and direction.

## ❗ Disclaimer

This is a speculative framework in development.  
I am not a formally trained physicist, and this work has not been peer-reviewed. My goal is not to replace established science but to explore alternative perspectives with rigor and openness.

## 🤖 Collaboration with AI

This project is a collaboration between human intuition and AI assistance:  

- Core ideas, philosophy, and symbolic direction: **Human**  
- Mathematical derivations, simulations, and formatting: **AI assistance**  

The AI serves as a computational partner—not the source of the theory.

## 👀 Awareness of Limitations

Both human and AI contributions may contain errors. This work is not a final answer—it is a scaffold for curiosity and further exploration.  

---

## 🧩 On Openness

This project is released as a polished edition to encourage readability and engagement.  
The private repo retains the raw, timestamped development log as proof of origin.  

ψ-gravity is not a finished theory but a **seed**: if it inspires you, refine it, challenge it, or branch it into something new.
